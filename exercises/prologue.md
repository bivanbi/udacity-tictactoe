# Prologue

Udacity's TicTacToe project represents a quite lifelike situation: a developer needs to extend a codebase 
with new functions. While examining the starter codebase, it is quite possible that one might find 
deprecated or incomplete language features, project or tool configuration etc.
There might be obsolete or antipattern techniques, typos and even bugs. It is natural that not only the
new feature needs to be added, but those shortcomings be fixed or updated as well.

This collection of exercises represents a real journey of a hobbyist developer, pursuing better coding habits,
through cleaning up legacy codebase, refactoring existing code for readability, flexibility and (re)usability.
Concentrating not only on the codebase, but the surroundings as well: code versioning, build environment and such.

One might argue with the approaches or patterns used in the exercises. Rightfully so.
The original author of this documentation is a hobbyist, learning along the way.
There might be mistakes. The point is, one can learn from mistakes too. It is good to know why
something can be benefial, but it is also important what and why is to be avoided.

So, if you find something that is not right: kudos for you!
Your critical thinking helps to improve your piece of code!
Also, if you have the time,
please [open an issue at GitHub](https://github.com/bivanbi/udacity-tictactoe/issues),
so we can extend the collection. :)
