# Udacity's TicTacToe Continued 
Udacity has this great free [Java Programming Basics course](https://www.udacity.com/course/java-programming-basics--ud282),
which has a project called Tic Tac Toe.

I was quite inspired by that project and wanted to improve beyond the original Udacity course.

The goal is to gradually make the code better, the game board more flexible and the 'AI' a bit more challenging.
We will be actively using Git [branching / merging](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
and probably other concepts as well.

## Licensing
Udacity has not disclosed a license along with the course material.
My best guess that since the repository is public, the course is free, you are free to use
and modify it as long as you attribute the original authors.
