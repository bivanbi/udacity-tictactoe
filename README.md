# Udacity's TicTacToe Continued 
Udacity has this great free [Java Programming Basics course](https://www.udacity.com/course/java-programming-basics--ud282),
which has a project called Tic Tac Toe.

I was quite inspired by that project and wanted to improve beyond the original Udacity course.

The goal is to gradually make the code better, the game board more flexible and the 'AI' a bit more challenging.
We will be actively using Git [branching / merging](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
and probably other concepts as well.
